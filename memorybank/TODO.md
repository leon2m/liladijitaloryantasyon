# Lila Explorer - Roadmap & Future Work (TODO)

This document outlines planned features, improvements, and refactoring tasks for the Lila Explorer application.

## 1. Critical: Backend & API Migration

- [ ] **Transition to a Real Backend**: Replace the `localStorage`-based `apiService` with a real backend service (e.g., Node.js/Express, Python/Django, or a serverless solution).
- [ ] **Database Integration**: Implement a robust database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) to properly store all user data, results, and application state.
- [ ] **Real Gemini API Integration**: Replace the simulated `generateInterpretation` function with actual API calls to the Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash`) to provide genuine, dynamic, and higher-quality text analysis.
- [ ] **Secure API Endpoints**: Implement a proper authentication mechanism (e.g., JWT) to secure all API endpoints.
- [ ] **Server-Side Validation**: Add comprehensive input validation and error handling on the backend.

## 2. Frontend Enhancements & Refactoring

- [ ] **Improve Accessibility (a11y)**: Conduct a full accessibility audit. Add necessary ARIA attributes, ensure keyboard navigability, and test for screen reader compatibility.
- [ ] **State Management**: For better scalability, consider migrating key global state (like user and test results) from component drilling to a dedicated state management library (e.g., Redux Toolkit, Zustand).
- [ ] **Testing**:
    - [ ] Implement unit tests for critical components and services (e.g., `apiService` logic, `TestRunner`).
    - [ ] Add end-to-end tests for key user flows like registration, test completion, and recovery.
- [ ] **Code Quality**:
    - [ ] Remove obsolete files (e.g., `services/geminiService.ts`).
    - [ ] Add JSDoc comments to services and complex components to improve maintainability.
    - [ ] Perform a dependency audit and update packages as needed.

## 3. New Feature Development

- [ ] **Advanced Chatbot**: Upgrade the simple keyword-based chatbot to a truly conversational AI using the Gemini API's chat functionality. This will provide more natural and helpful user support.
- [ ] **Admin Panel**: Create a secure administrative dashboard to:
    - [ ] View analytics and aggregated user results.
    - [ ] Manage test content (add/edit questions) without code changes.
    - [ ] Look up users and assist with account issues.
- [ ] **PDF Report Generation**: Add a "Download as PDF" feature on the results page to allow users to save a professionally formatted report of their test outcomes.
- [ ] **Team/Group Functionality**:
    - [ ] Introduce the concept of "Teams" or "Organizations."
    - [ ] Allow an admin to invite users to a team.
    - [ ] Generate aggregated reports on a team's collective Belbin roles or Social Color distribution.
- [ ] **Internationalization (i18n)**: Refactor hardcoded strings (currently in Turkish) into a localization framework to support multiple languages.
- [ ] **User Profile Page**: Create a page where users can perform actions like deleting their account and all associated data (GDPR compliance).

## 4. UI/UX Improvements

- [ ] **Animations & Transitions**: Add more subtle and meaningful animations for page transitions and component interactions to enhance the user experience.
- [ ] **Empty State Enhancements**: Improve the design of empty states (e.g., an empty History page) with better visuals and clearer calls to action.
- [ ] **QR Code Scanning**: On the "Enter Recovery Code" page, add the ability to use the device's camera to scan the recovery QR code, improving usability.
