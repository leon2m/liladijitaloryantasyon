# Lila Dijital Oryantasyon Programı - Implemented Features (DONE)

This file lists the features and functionalities that have been successfully implemented in the application as of the current version.

## Backend & Architecture
- [x] **Backend Migration**: Successfully migrated from a `localStorage`-based mock to a real FastAPI backend.
- [x] **RESTful API Integration**: Frontend services (`apiService`) now communicate with live backend endpoints.
- [x] **Dual Authentication Model**: Implemented frontend logic to handle both user device tokens (`X-Device-Token`) and admin JWTs (`Authorization: Bearer`).
- [x] **Backend-Powered AI Chat**: The chat interface now routes messages through a secure backend endpoint instead of a client-side library.

## Admin Panel
- [x] **Admin Authentication**: Created a secure login page for administrators (`/admin/login`).
- [x] **Admin Layout**: Built a dedicated layout with a sidebar for all admin pages.
- [x] **Dashboard**: Implemented a dashboard displaying key statistics (total users, total tests) and a chart for test distribution.
- [x] **User Management**: Admins can view a list of all users and their completed test counts.
- [x] **User Results Viewer**: Admins can drill down to see the specific test results for any user.
- [x] **Test Management**: A complete CRUD interface for managing tests, including a form-based editor for questions, options, and scoring profiles.

## Core Application & UI

- [x] **Project Scaffolding**: Set up a React + TypeScript project without a traditional build step, using `importmap`.
- [x] **Styling**: Implemented a full UI theme using Tailwind CSS and custom global styles, featuring an animated gradient background and "glassmorphism" cards.
- [x] **Responsive Design**: The main layout and components are responsive and functional across different screen sizes.
- [x] **Layout System**: Created a dual-layout system: a centered view for unauthenticated users and a sidebar-based layout for authenticated users.
- [x] **Navigation**: Implemented a persistent sidebar for easy navigation between the Dashboard, Orientation, and History pages.

## Authentication & User Management

- [x] **Device-Based Authentication**: Implemented a password-less login system based on a device-specific token.
- [x] **User Onboarding**: Users can create a new profile simply by providing their first and last name.
- [x] **Logout Functionality**: Users can securely log out, which clears the device token from local storage.

## Psychometric Assessments

- [x] **Test Engine**: Developed a flexible `TestRunner` component that can render and manage any test defined in the JSON format.
- [x] **Test Content**: Integrated three complete psychometric tests:
    - [x] Belbin Team Roles
    - [x] Social Color Personality
    - [x] Learning Styles
- [x] **Progress Tracking**: A progress bar visually indicates the user's progress through the current test.
- [x] **Test Resumption**: Users can leave a test mid-way and resume from where they left off.

## Results & Reporting

- [x] **Results Page**: Created a dedicated page to display detailed test results.
- [x] **Data Visualization**: Integrated `recharts` to display results in dynamic, visually appealing charts (Radar chart for Belbin, Bar chart for others).
- [x] **AI Interpretation**: The application provides a personalized, text-based interpretation of the results, powered by the backend AI service.
- [x] **Results Persistence**: All completed test results are saved via the backend.

## User Experience & Features

- [x] **Dashboard**: A central "Keşif Paneli" (Discovery Panel) that serves as the user's main hub.
- [x] **History Archive**: A `History` page where users can view a list of their previously completed tests, sorted by date.

    - [x] A multi-step onboarding experience is available from the sidebar and dashboard.
    - [x] Orientation progress is tracked and saved for each user.
    - [x] The module integrates directly with the testing engine, prompting users to take specific tests as part of their orientation.
- [x] **AI Chat**: An AI-powered chat page (`/chat`) provides helpful answers to user questions.
- [x] **Loading States**: Implemented loading spinners and UI feedback for all asynchronous operations, ensuring a smooth user experience.
